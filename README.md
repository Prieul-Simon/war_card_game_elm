# War Card Game (in Elm)

This is a simple implementation of the card game "War", using the functional programming language `Elm` (https://elm-lang.org/)

You can also see my original implementation of this game in JavaScript : https://github.com/Prieul-Simon/war_card_game

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)

## Building Locally

Run the following command:

```bash
elm make src/Main.elm --output=main.js
```

## Usage

For running the program:
```bash
open game.html
```

Some terminals may not have an `open` command, in which case you should open the game.html file in your browser another way.

Tested with elm 0.19.1
